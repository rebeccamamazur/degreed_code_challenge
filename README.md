## What to know about this Solution

I chose to use Angular 2+ for the opportunity to work with it (and because the devtools for it are way better than I remember them being in AngularJS!).  

I used Angular CLI to generate the project, again, for the chance to experiment with it.  Because of that you'll notice that the project is somewhat heavy (in a perfect world I'd clear out some of the cruft, but for now, it is what it is).  Below is a guide to what's of most interest in the project; I've left out unchanged files generated by Angular CLI; bolded items have the most custom work in them.

* /app -- source directory
  * /app/src/ -- project code
    * /app/src/app/ -- components, services, scoped styles
      * **/app/src/app/decade-toggle/ -- scripts and styles for the decade toggle**
      * **/app/src/app/movie-detail/ -- scripts and styles for a single movie card**
      * **/app/src/app/movies/ -- scripts and styles for the movie list loop**
      * /app/src/app/app.component.&ast; -- scripts, styles, and templates for the root module
      * **/app/src/app/date-filter.service.ts -- service to manage which decade is currently selected it and emit it as an observable for the listing and toggle to use it.**
      * **/app/src/app/in-memory-data.service.ts -- this isn't in use in the final product, but was used to test against to save hits against the live API in development**
      * **/app/src/app/mock&ast; -- Also not in use in the final product; provided static content to test against prior to implementing the in-memory-data.service**
      * **/app/src/app/movie-detail.ts, and movie-search-response.ts, movie.ts, and  -- interfaces to define expected shape of a movie detail, the results of a movie search, or a single movie**
      * **/app/src/app/movies.service.ts -- service to make api calls and provide their results as observables.**
    * /app/src/assets/ -- local images
    * /app/src/styles.scss -- generic styles
  * /app/* -- files generated by Angular CLI; most of these are unchanged, with the exception of angular.json, which has been modified to output the dist folder in a level up in the folder structure.
* /dist -- generated project.  The finished project should run in a self-contained manner from this folder.
